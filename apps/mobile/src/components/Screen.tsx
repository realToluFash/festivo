/**
 * The documented way to build a screen. Use this, not a bare View.
 *
 * Android runs edge to edge, so the layout owns the area behind the status and
 * navigation bars and something has to keep content out of them. A screen built
 * on a bare View looks correct on the simulator it was written on and puts a
 * button under the home indicator on the next device.
 *
 * Insets are applied as PADDING on an outer view rather than as a margin,
 * because a margin leaves the background colour short of the bar and shows the
 * window behind it.
 *
 * `useSafeAreaInsets` rather than SafeAreaView: the hook gives the numbers, so
 * a screen that wants the inset at the bottom but not the top — a docked footer
 * over a full-bleed header — can say so. SafeAreaView is all or nothing.
